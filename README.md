# A usable spatial data publication platform
This repository is a placeholder for project management around developments in topic2 of the spatial-data-on-the-web testbed.

Topic 2 is about a platform approach for spatial data on the web, making it easy to find and use. The leading perspective of this research topic is using the data.
Its goal is to find out how to make spatial data e.g. the Dutch Base registry Addresses and Buildings (BAG) easy to find and more specifically to explore the data 
of 'government as a platform' i.e. make data easier to use by providing not only the data itself but also a community surrounding is.

Here is a short overview of the different parts that Spotzi will address:

<br>Task 1: Updating data
<br>Task 2: Workflows
<br>Task 3: Searchable datastore
<br>Task 4: Non spatial data
<br>Task 5: Link to formal definitions
<br>Task 6: Toolchain
<br>Task 7: Reference system
<br>Task 8: Linked Data
<br>Task 9: Showcase
